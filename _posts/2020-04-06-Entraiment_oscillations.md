In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding how rhythmic auditory stimulation can selectively modulate EEG oscillations. 

Recent evidence in sensory stimulation suggests that standard methods of data analysis are often insufficient for a definite proof of entrainment. In particular, we stress that the complexity of the elicited modulations, often varying in phase and frequency on a short timescale, requires time-frequency measures that are better appropriate to analyze driven brain phenomena.

We discuss when the oscillatory entrainment is clearly established and assess the specificity of its expression. From this, we discuss how oscillatory entraintment can provide a better understanding of the physiology underlying its brain modulation. We further discuss how entrainment analsysis provide a faster translation to treatment programs in various psychopathologic conditions.
