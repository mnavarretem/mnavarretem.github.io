Is it really possible to learn new information during deep sleep? A new study by [Züst et al](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)31672-5) suggests that implicit vocabulary binding can occur while we are snoozing. It also seems that the success of learning depends heavily upon the timing of such ‘sleepy stimulation’.

We briefly discuss what could be the conditions for implicit word encoding during sleep
