I am passionate about the multiple possibilities that engineering has in order to contribute to the development of neurosciences. My research is focused on the study of signal processing methods for the analysis of brain activity.

I enjoy the understanding of the complex relationships of the brain activity in physiological and cognitive contexts. Specifically, I am amazed by the neural interactions at multiple levels: from the mutual dependency of the single neuron activity to the organization of structural and functional brain networks. 

I feel comfortable using different data analysis techniques. Indeed, I have developed software, new algorithms and techniques for offline and real-time analysis for EEG signals from sleep and epilepsy. Neverthelss, in my work I do not only settle with the elaboration of the methods for the study of the brain activity, but I also integrate the biological context for understanding which are the physiological implications of these analyses. For this reason, I work closely with physiologists and psychologists to deeply understand the basis of epilepsy, sleep and memory.
