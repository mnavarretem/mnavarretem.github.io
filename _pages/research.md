## Sleep
My work is focused on the analysis and development of methodological techniques to manipulate the main electrophysiological rhythms prevailing in the sleeping brain. I am interested in understanding how these rhythms are related to different cognitive functions as memory and creativity.

I have developed real-time stimulation systems to modulate brain rhythms during sleep, studying the cognitive and physiological response of this stimulation.

## Epilepsy
High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) in the brain have been associated with different physiological and pathological processes. In epilepsy, HFOs might reflect a mechanism of epileptic phenomena, serving as a biomarker of epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity. Despite the valuable information provided by HFOs, their correct identification is a challenging task. My research in epilepsy has been focused in the detection and evaluation of these fast events using intracranial elctrodes. 

 I have developed software and algorithms for the detection and identification of different parameters in the characteristic EEG signals in this pathology.

## Software
* [RIPPLELAB](https://github.com/BSP-Uniandes/RIPPLELAB): RIPPLELAB is a multi-window GUI developed in MATLAB for the analysis of high frequency oscillations
